  Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

  # Overview
  
  <p>For this project we were tasked with using PostgreSQL and the SQL language to create a database for Pewlett-Hackard which can then be used to glean useful information from.</p>
  
  ## Results
<p> Once the database was analyzed it became clear that there was a "Silver Wave" coming for Pewlett-Hackard in the sense that they have over 70,000 employees who will soon be reaching retirement age. Additionally it became a concern that many of these close-to-retirees were in senior positions. The breakdown of their titles is as follows:

<p>To combat this wave the company wants to introduce a mentorship program where these retiring employees first teach younger employees to help make the transition easier. We used the database to find a list of employees eligible to be the mentees. 1549 employees fit this critera. </p>
