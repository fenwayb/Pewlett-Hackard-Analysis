  Pewlett-Hackard Analysis

  # Overview
  
  <p>For this project we were tasked with using PostgreSQL and the SQL language to create a database for Pewlett-Hackard which can then be used to glean useful information from.</p>
  
  ## Results
<p> Once the database was analyzed it became clear that there was a "Silver Wave" coming for Pewlett-Hackard in the sense that they have over 70,000 employees who will soon be reaching retirement age. Additionally it became a concern that many of these close-to-retirees were in senior positions. The breakdown of their titles is as follows:

<p>To combat this wave the company wants to introduce a mentorship program where these retiring employees first teach younger employees to help make the transition easier. We used the database to find a list of employees eligible to be the mentees. 1549 employees fit this critera, which is only employees born in 1965. </p>

  <p> the following chart shows the breakdown of retirees by department </p>

  ***
* That is a lot of senior employees!
* Many of the people retiring are managers
* Development and Production teams are losing the most employees as shown above
* Finance, Human Resources, Quality Management, and Research seem to be less affected by this wave
  
  # Overview
  <p> This project showed that 72,458 employees are soon to retire from Pewlett-Hackard and 1,549 mentees fiting their requirements. The following chart shows that Pewlett-Hackard is orders of magnitude off from being able to mentor enough people to fill the retiring roles at all title levels. Maybe they should consider widening their window of potential mentees beyond a single birth year.
